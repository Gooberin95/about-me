            Hi I'm Lacey
        </h2>

        <p> I was born in Chicago, IL on Thursday March 17<sup>th</sup> 1994 to my lovely mother Daphne.
            I was born with weak constitution and spent most of my childhood in hospitals because of asthma.
            I have two brothers, one that is six years older than me and on that seven years younger than me.
            We grew up in a educated family but, still below the poverty line. As a child I struggled terribly in
            school because I missed a lot of days because of my asthma and on top of that I was diagnosed with ADHD
            and dyslexia. The public school I was in at the time wanted to put me in remedial class but thanks to my
            mom knowing that I was not dumb I needed more attention took time off of work for months to get me caught up
            with the rest of the kids. She eventually took me out of public school and found a small christian grammar
            school to
            put me in where I flourished into the bright young man and ultimately graduated and went to high school
            where I learned
            learned how to read music and play the saxophone and developed a passion for it. There I struggled with my
            mental health and had to miss out on more school but I still managed to graduated
            and then I went to college in Colorado.</p>

            My Goals
        </h2>
        <p>
            I have many different goals but right now my short term goal is to get through Code Fellows with flying
            colors.
            I don't want to just learn how to code and be a mediocre programmer. I want to be damn good at coding it.
            I want to be so good that companies are having salary wars over me. Some long term goals of mine are to
            design a application software at my job that makes keeping track of samples more efficient and convenient.
            I also want to quit smoking and get more control over my health and be more physically fit. I also want to
            make enough money to renovate my family home because it's over 100 years old and three generations of
            Washington's
            have lived in it. I want to travel across asia for a while. As far as for my career goals I have two
            aspirations
            I want to work for Maxis the gaming studio at Electronic Arts that makes The Sims 4 or work at google in
            youtube.
